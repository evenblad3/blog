## Deleting Apps
No, before you wonder why you gonna delete some apps even though you are using everything, there are still some apps you have to delete especially *if you're using some low-end hardware*. Things like Whatsapp desktop, YouTube or Instagram shortcut, etc can be used on web browsers. Come on, if you really want to speed up your computer you really have to do it. This way **you can save some space** in your computer's secondary storage. There's a lot of tweaks you can do in web browsers and I'll show you how to do it soon now.
