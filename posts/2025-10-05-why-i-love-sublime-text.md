# Why?
It's fast and runs on a trashy laptops and computers. Even though it made in Electron (I think so), its still fast. As far as I know Electron is a framework for building apps fast and there are chances that it might need additional optimizations in JS.
But surprisingly this text editor has exceed my expectation.

## Cool Things
You can do a few text editing actions with shortcuts and for me honestly it is time saving! These are the most common stuff I do in Sublime:

 - **Ctrl+Shift+â†‘** - To move current line's contents upward (vice verse to move stuff down)
 - **Ctrl+Shift+D** - To duplicate selected contents or current line
 - **Ctrl+G** - Go to line

Other than this, I've never tried anything else much xd.

# Installation
Installation is pretty straightforward for Windows and for Linux refer the [installation page](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/linux_repositories.html) or you can just directly download the binary versions.

# Things I've Did
## Custom Theme
After installing it I found the theme unpleasant to me, I like darker theme a lot. I've used dark theme much often that it hurts my eyes when I use light themed apps lol!
Anyways, if you want **custom themes** go ahead and install the package manager first which allows you to install packages. It just similar to installing Blender add-ons or After Effects plugins but inside the app. And then look for [Colorsublime](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Colorsublime) package, install it, wait for it to fetch themes from some magic site and choose the theme you like. I used [Brogrammer](https://colorsublime.github.io/themes/Brogrammer/) theme, looks very nice to me.

## LSP (auto-correct)
This is one of the coolest packages I am using for Python and C++. These are the packages I am using for now (at least at the time of writing this blog post):
- **Python** - [LSP-pylsp](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-pylsp) 
- **C/C++** - [LSP-clangd](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-clangd)
I used to use [EasyClangComplete](https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete) for C++ but it was quite heavy on my laptop (2011 build ðŸ˜­) and it kept adding `>` after sublime makes pair of angular brackets, I found no solution to it.

I apologize I forgot how I installed it (the easy way ofc), I had some issues when installing it and I did a few work-around to make it work. Just refer the real documentations and follow the steps carefully and it should work for you :)

## Browsersync
Dang, I just found that [this plugin](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Browser%20Sync) was archived 2 years back lol but its still working as expected for me, I never used anything else than this plugin for developing web pages.
Oh if you don't know what this plugin does, in simple words it lets you see your webpage's latest changes as soon as you save your webpage's source code so there won't be any need to reload your browser manually.

# Final Words
That's all I want to mention for this post, other than that we'll discover more cool stuff in the future, until then stay safe!
