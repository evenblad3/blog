# Tired Of Email Spam?
Yo! So we're going to see how we can prevent spam mails, promotion mails and allat crap. Without further ado, less go!

## Unsubscribe
Yes, this sounds boring but this is one of the things you should do first. Look at every mail and unsubscribe those business mails. Things like Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook and other notification or advertising mails can be pretty annoying and filling up your mail inbox. So go ahead, unsubscribe now.

## Using Temporay Mail Services
This is a *very cool* thing the internet has blessed us with, disposable or temporary mails. Basically, when you use those services, the mail you use from those services will be delete after a certain period of time. And no more ad mails or sum bullcrap, **you're just free from it!**
Some temporary mail services you can use right now:

 - [temp-mail.org](https://temp-mail.org/)
 - [temp-mail.io](https://temp-mail.io/)
 - [tempmail.so](https://tempmail.so/)
 - [tempmailo.com](https://tempmailo.com/)

## Bonus Tip
Some sites don't allow you to read content, like when you want to look for some article for research purposes and it brings up some "Sign in and continue reading..." popup BS, you can use these disposable mail services to **free yourself** from it!

## Final Words
These services are very helpful to prevent yourself from hacking, bot spam, ad mails, etc. And use it ethically of course ;)
Have a good day!
