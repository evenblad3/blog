# Top Windows Shortcuts Every Wannabe Programmers Should Know
Yo, I'd like to share some cool shortcut keys y'all beginners should know which could save you hell lot of time and this is not going to be some `Ctrl + C/V` BS, I'm going share something much cooler that you can use your Windows computer without a mouse.

First thing I'll do when I open ny computer to open the explorer is by pressing `Win + E`. And then to check if my computer is connected to the internet, I open cmd with `Ctrl + R -> cmd` and then check it with `ping google.com`. Oh you can also open Command Prompt by pressing `Win + X -> C`. If you have a Windows 10 computer and if you want to run **cmd as admin** you might want to change that in the settings as usually it would be powershell as admin.

Next to browse the internet I open **Run** with `Ctrl + R` and then type `chrome` (`msedge` if you have edge, but don't use both of these lol). I got multiple profiles on my Chrome browser, I press `Tab` a few times to go forward and press `Shift + Tab` few time to go back. Same shortcut applies to most apps, you can go back and forth with those shortcuts.

And then if you got some apps pinned to the taskbar you can launch them with `Win + [x]`, where *x* is their spot number. Like if you have MS Paint as 4th one, just hit`Win + 4`.

Sometimes having to manually drag the windows to have them side by side can be painful. Press `Win + ←` to set the current window to the left. `Win + →` to the right, `Win + ↑` to maximize and `Win + ↓` to minimize.

You can also bring up the **Project to a connected screen** menu with `Win + P`, very useful if you want to turn on/off your monitors.

`Alt + Tab` to cycle between apps, sets to the selected window as soon as you release the `Tab` key. Hit `Alt + Shift + Tab` to backward. Hit `Ctrl + Alt + Tab` to have the selection window opened and press `Enter` when you want to go to the selected window.

`Ctrl + Tab` to switch between browser tabs, additionally press `Shift` to go backward.

`Ctrl + Alt + Del`, opens up **Windows security window**, lowkey useful when you wanna get out of applications fast that doesn't minimize when pressing `Win` key.

`Win + L` to lock your PC when you're going AFK, always practice this. You might not't know who messes with your PC.

And when you're typing something and want to place your cursor in between some words you can press `Ctrl + ←` to go to the left side of the whole ass word and `Ctrl + Shift + ←` to select the word going left side. Vice versa for right side.
Press `End` to get your cursor to the end of the line and vice verse for `Home`.

That's it for today's post, see you later :)
